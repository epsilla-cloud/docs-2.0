# Set Up Your AI Agent

Currently Epsilla supports two types of agents: Chatbot Agents and Smart Search Agents. Chatbot Agents provide an interactive experience similar to ChatGPT, generating context-aware responses for use cases such as customer support or domain-specific conversations, often tailored to specific knowledge bases. Smart Search Agents focus on efficient information retrieval, inspired by platforms like Perplexity. They excel in providing precise answers to user queries, making them ideal for use cases such as research, content discovery, and data-driven decision-making.

### **Navigate to the Application Tab**

In your Epsilla Cloud dashboard, click on the **Create Application** button located on the navigation bar.

### **Define the Chatbot Role**

Technically this is the system prompt to instruct the LLM to behave with desired personality. For instance, if you're creating a tax assistant, you could use a system prompt like:

* "You are a professional CPA specializing in individual taxation. Utilize your expert knowledge of tax laws and regulations to ensure clients benefit from all applicable deductions and credits. Provide clear explanations to clients about their tax situations and the implications of their financial decisions."

This role setup is crucial as it helps ensure that the chatbotâ€™s responses are aligned with your intended use case.

### **Add Knowledge to the Chatbot**

**Link the Knowledge Base**: Select the knowledge base you created and attach it to your chatbot. This ensures that the chatbot can ground its responses in the specific data you provided, making answers more relevant and accurate. You can add multiple knowledge bases to an AI agent.
