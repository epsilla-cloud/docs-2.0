# Publish Your AI Agent

Once you are happy with the AI Agent, you can publish the chatbot and share with your friends, family and colleagues by allowing all Epsilla Cloud users to access.

Click the **Publish** tab from the left hand side panel:

### **Publishing Options**

When publishing an AI agent, you have three levels of access to choose from:

1. **Access to Project Members Only (Default):**\
   The AI agent will only be accessible to members of current project. This option is ideal for testing or internal use within a controlled environment.
2. **Access to All Epsilla Cloud Users:**\
   The AI agent will be available to all users within the Epsilla Cloud platform, allowing the broader Epsilla Cloud community to interact with the agent.
3. **Access to Anyone with the Link:**\
   The AI agent can be shared publicly through a link, making it accessible to anyone outside of Epsilla Cloud.

### **Publishing to App Portal**

If the access level is set to "All Epsilla Cloud Users" or "Anyone with the Link," you also have the option to publish the AI agent to the **App Portal**. This ensures the agent is easily discoverable by everyone, increasing its visibility and reach.

### Access Link

An access link allows you to easily share your AI agent with others based on your selected level of access. Whether it's restricted to project members, available to all Epsilla Cloud users, or open to anyone with the link, the access link provides a convenient way for others to engage with your agent. For broader engagement, you can directly share this link with the community or your intended audience.

People opening the chatbot by directly accessing the link or through the App Portal will see it like this:
