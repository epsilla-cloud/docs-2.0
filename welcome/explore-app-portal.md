# Explore App Portal

The **Epsilla App Portal** provides a centralized platform for users to **browse** and **interact with AI agents** created by the Epsilla community. The Portal is designed to offer a straightforward experience for those looking to explore a variety of applications built on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology.

Through the Portal, users can select and try out AI agents designed for various purposes, from everyday tasks to more complex decision-making support. Each AI agent is based on user-provided data and models, allowing for tailored solutions across different industries and use cases.

There are two types of agents: Chatbot Agents and Smart Search Agents.

### Chatbot Agents

Chatbot agents provide an interactive conversational experience similar to **ChatGPT**. Users can engage with these chatbots by asking questions or discussing various topics in natural language. The agents are designed to generate context-aware, coherent responses, making them ideal for customer support, personal assistance, or domain-specific conversations. Chatbot agents are often tailored to specific knowledge base, allowing for personalized and accurate information delivery:

### Smart Search Agents

Smart Search Agents are modeled after platforms like **Perplexity**. They are optimized for retrieving and presenting relevant information quickly and efficiently. Instead of focusing on conversational flow, these agents excel in conducting searches and returning precise, factual answers based on user queries. Smart Search agents are particularly useful for research, content discovery, and data-driven decision-making, leveraging advanced retrieval techniques for accuracy and relevance:
